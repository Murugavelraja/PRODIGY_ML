Tasks
------

### Task 1: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

- **Goal:**
  
Create a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various characteristics.
 
- **Key Features:**
     
     - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to pinpoint major features affecting house prices.
     - Utilized Linear Regression for price estimations.
     - Visualized outcomes to comprehend model efficacy and predictions.
     
### Task 3: Cat vs. Dog Classification using SVM

 - **Goal:**

   Develop a model to differentiate between images of cats and dogs using Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques.
  
- **Key Features:**
     
     - Gathered and preprocessed data for image classification.
     - Implemented SVM for accurate classification results.
     - Evaluated performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
